# GitHub Pages Deployment Debug Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow is passing, but the website shows a 404 error at https://karlos37.github.io/teeya-kapur-portfolio/

## 🔍 Root Cause
This typically happens when GitHub Pages settings are not configured to use GitHub Actions as the source.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/karlos37/teeya-kapur-portfolio/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify the Workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/karlos37/teeya-kapur-portfolio/actions
2. Look for the "Deploy React Portfolio to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Ensure it shows a green checkmark (success)

### Step 3: Check Deployment Status
After completing Step 1, the workflow should automatically trigger and deploy your site.

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Deployment
If GitHub Actions continues to have issues, you can use the manual deployment:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will deploy to the `gh-pages` branch, and you can then set GitHub Pages to deploy from that branch.

## 📋 Expected Result
Once configured correctly, your portfolio will be live at:
**https://karlos37.github.io/teeya-kapur-portfolio**

## 🚨 Common Issues
- **404 Error**: GitHub Pages source not set to "GitHub Actions"
- **Blank Page**: Base path mismatch (should be `/teeya-kapur-portfolio/`)
- **Build Fails**: Check Actions tab for error details

## 📞 Next Steps
1. Complete Step 1 above (most important)
2. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
3. Check the website again
4. If still not working, check the Actions tab for any errors
