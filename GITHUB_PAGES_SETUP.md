# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue Fixed
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing due to permission issues. I've updated the workflow to use the official GitHub Pages deployment actions with proper permissions.

## ✅ What I've Fixed

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** - Now uses official `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
2. **Added Proper Permissions** - Configured `pages: write` and `id-token: write` permissions
3. **Used Official Actions** - Replaced third-party action with GitHub's official deployment actions

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/karlos37/teeya-kapur-portfolio
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify the Workflow

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see the "Deploy React Portfolio to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click on it to see the deployment status
4. The workflow should now run successfully without permission errors

## 🌍 Expected Result

Once the workflow completes successfully, your portfolio will be available at:
**https://karlos37.github.io/teeya-kapur-portfolio**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If the workflow still fails:

1. **Check Repository Settings:**
   - Ensure Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - Verify the repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)

2. **Check Workflow Permissions:**
   - Go to Settings > Actions > General
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

3. **Manual Deployment (Backup Option):**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This will still work as a backup method.

## 📱 Portfolio Features

Your portfolio includes:

- ✅ Professional gradient styling
- ✅ Resume PDF download functionality

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Complete the GitHub Pages setup (Step 1 above)
2. Wait for the workflow to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Visit your live portfolio
4. Customize the content with your actual information:
   - Add professional headshot
   - Update project details
   - Add real contact information
   - Replace placeholder content

The deployment should now work perfectly with the updated workflow!
